# Place the item -2
You have html markup defined, implement the css.
 Using flexbox properties on element. holder,
 Make the items appear in a row, such that all elements are squished together
 in the center of the row.
 Also put the property on holder such that if more items are added in holder
 they dont squish, and instead just go on the next row.
 
 Do not change the html markup, only change the css code of. holder
